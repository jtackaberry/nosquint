<h2 id='general'>General Tab</h2>

<p>To NoSquint, a site is a web location where all pages have the same zoom
level and color settings, and the site name is derived from the page's URL.</p>

<p>In most cases, the site is the domain.  For example, if the current page is
<code>www2.ibm.com/index.php</code>, NoSquint will consider the site name to be
<code>ibm.com</code>.  NoSquint will also take into account common country-specific
second-level domains.  For example, if you're visiting
<code>www.bbc.co.uk</code>, NoSquint will consider the site name to be
<code>bbc.co.uk</code>.</p>

<p>The default behaviour should work almost all the time.  When it doesn't, you
can control how NoSquint determines site names in the 
<a href='#exceptions'>Exceptions Tab</a>.</p>

<h3>Per-site settings (color and zoom)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Remember per-site settings between Firefox restarts</b>
            <p>With this option selected, NoSquint will remember any changes
            you make to the zoom levels and color choices for a given site, and
            the changes are stored on disk so they can be applied even if you
            restart Firefox.</p>
            <p>Both full page zoom and text zoom levels are remembered
            independently.  Next time you visit that site, NoSquint will use
            the zoom and colors previously used on that site.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Forget settings for sites not visited in the last ...</b>
            <p>With the "Remember per-site settings between Firefox restarts"
            option enabled, NoSquint keeps track of all zoom level and color
            changes for sites, even sites you only visit once.  This option is
            house cleaning: if you haven't visited a site (for which you've set
            a non-default zoom or color setting) for the specified number of
            months, NoSquint will forget the setting.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Erase NoSquint site history when Firefox clears private data</b>
            <p>When you change the default zoom levels or colors for a given
            site, NoSquint remembers that change, which means it must keep a 
            record of those sites.  From a privacy perspective, this is similar
            to your browsing history.  If this option is selected, when Firefox
            clears your private data (via Tools | Clear Private Data for Firefox
            3.0, and Tools | Clear Recent History for Firefox 3.5), it will
            also purge all site-specific data associated with NoSquint.</p>
            <p>Note that user-added <a href='#exceptions'>exceptions</a> are
            not cleared.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Forget all per-site settings when Firefox closes</b>
            <p>Per-site settings will be retained only for the current Firefox
            session.  They are never written to disk, and will therefore not
            be remembered if you restart Firefox.</p>
            <p>An alternative would be to use Firefox's Private Browsing mode
            (Firefox 3.5 and later), which NoSquint supports.  When Private
            Browsing is activated, even if "Remember per-site settings between
            Firefox restarts" is selected instead of this option, NoSquint will
            never store any per-site settings to disk which have changed while
            in that mode.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id='zooming'>Zooming Tab</h2>

<p>The options in this tab let you control the default zooming behavior as they
apply to all sites.  You can override the zoom levels for individual sites using
the Site Settings, which can be managed by left-clicking on NoSquint's status bar
icon, or selecting NoSquint Site Settings from the page's context menu.</p>

<h3>Default Zoom Options</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Primary zoom method</b>
            <p>The primary zoom method specifies the behaviour of the standard
            zoom adjustment shortcuts (ctrl-plus, ctrl-minus, ctrl-mousewheel).
            With <code>Full Page Zoom</code>, both images and text will be zoomed;
            with <code>Text Zoom</code>, only text is zoomed.  Whichever zoom method
            is <i>not</i> set to be primary is referred to as the secondary method.</p>

            <p>The shift key can be added to any of the shortcuts to control the
            secondary zoom method.  For example, if the primary zoom method is
            set to Full Page Zoom, and ctrl-shift-plus is pressed, only text size will
            be increased.</p>
    </li>
            
    <li>
        <b>Default full page zoom level</b>
            <p>This is the full page zoom level (affecting both images and
            text) which will be applied to all pages by default.  A value of
            100% is the standard Firefox zoom level without NoSquint.  With
            NoSquint, you can override this value to be larger or smaller.</p>

            <p>Modifying the full page zoom level when visiting a web page will
            override this value for that site.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Default text-only zoom level</b>
            <p>This is the text zoom level (affecting <i>only</i> text) which
            will be applied to all pages by default.  A value of 100% is the
            standard Firefox zoom level without NoSquint.  With NoSquint, you
            can override this value to be larger or smaller.</p>

            <p>Modifying the text zoom level when visiting a web page will
            override this value for that site.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Zoom increment</b>
            <p>You can change the zoom level for a page from the View menu, by
            using one of the zoom shortcuts (ctrl-plus/minus or
            ctrl-mousewheel), or by using the optional toolbar buttons.
            NoSquint can remember these changes.  This setting specifies what
            increment, in percent, to use when changing the zoom level.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Enable zoom with ctrl-mousewheel</b>
            <p>Selecting this option allows you to adjust the zoom level by
            pressing and holding the control key while moving the mousewheel up
            or down.  If ctrl-shift-mousewheel is used, this controls the
            secondary zoom method.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Show current zoom levels in status bar</b>
            <p>Selecting this option shows the zoom levels (both full page and
            text zoom) in the status bar for the current web page.  When
            hovering over the status panel, a tooltip will appear providing
            more information.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id='colors'>Colors Tab</h2>
<p>Sometimes website creators choose to use rather questionable color choices
which can significantly hinder readability.  NoSquint lets you override the
standard text colors for <i>all</i> sites here.  Or (probably more usefully),
you can modify per-site colors via the Site Settings, which can be managed by
left-clicking on NoSquint's status bar icon, or selecting NoSquint Site
Settings from the page's context menu.</p>

<h3>Text and Background</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Text</b>
            <p>Overrides the foreground color for all text on the page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Background</b>
            <p>Overrides the background color for the page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Disable background images</b>
            <p>Some sites may overlay text on background images, rendering the
            user-selected background color (above) ineffective.  You can disable
            those images by selecting this options.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Link Colors</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Unvisited</b>
            <p>The foreground text color to use for all links that have not been visited before.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Visited</b>
            <p>The foreground text color to use for all links that <i>have</i> been visited before.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Always underline links</b>
            <p>Some websites make it difficult to tell the difference between links and regular text.
            Selecting this option will force hyperlinks to always be underlined.</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<h2 id='exceptions'>Exceptions Tab</h2>

<p>Because not all web sites are structured the same, sometimes the default
logic NoSquint uses to determine the site name doesn't work the way you want it
to.  Using exceptions, you can control how NoSquint determines what constitutes
a separate site.</p>

<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<p>Exceptions are powerful and expressive, and unfortunately can be confusing.
They are specified using a simple custom grammar, <i>not</i> regular
expressions.  Before going into a detailed explanation, let's first examine
some common use-cases.  Hopefully one of these examples applies to your
case.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> different subdomains on SourceForge, e.g.
        <code>freevo.sourceforge.net</code> and
        <code>audacity.sourceforge.net</code>, are wrongly treated as the same
        site (<code>sourceforge.net</code>)<br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>*.sourceforge.net</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> <code>example.com/users/mary</code> and
        <code>example.com/users/john</code> are wrongly treated as the same
        site (<code>example.com</code>)<br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>example.com/users/*</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> I use Google Mail (<code>mail.google.com</code>) and
        Google Reader (<code>google.com/reader</code>) and would like these
        treated as sites separate from <code>google.com</code><br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>mail.google.com</code>; add another exception with the pattern
        <code>google.com/reader</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> my company's intranet is at
        <code>intra.example.com</code>, but I'd like our wiki, located under
        <code>intra.example.com/wiki</code> to be treated separately from the
        rest of the intranet.<br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>intra.example.com/wiki</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> Google Mail, Google Groups, and in fact all hosts on
        Google should be treated as separate sites.  But the country (the
        top-level domain) shouldn't matter.  So <code>mail.google.ca</code>
        should be the same site as <code>mail.google.de</code>, but a different
        site from <code>groups.google.de</code>, which itself would be the same
        site as <code>groups.google.fi</code><br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern <code>*.google.[*]</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> my company has several web applications that are
        distributed across multiple servers.
        <code>example.com/server1/apps/app1</code> should be considered the
        same site as <code>example.com/server2/apps/app1</code>, but there
        could also be <code>example.com/server1/apps/app3</code> that should be
        a separate site.<br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>example.com/[*]/apps/*</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> same scenario as the previous one, but sometimes the
        server isn't in the URL, so <code>example.com/apps/app1</code> is
        the same site as <code>example.com/server1/apps/app1</code>.<br/>

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>example.com/[**]apps/*</code>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Gory Details</h3>
<p>What follows is a technical explanation of exceptions.  If you're not an
advanced user, this section may create a fair amount of confusion; refer
instead to the use-cases above to follow by example.</p>

<p>Exception patterns may contain zero or more of the following possible wildcards:
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>*</code> &ndash; When included in the host name, matches any character
        except a dot ('.').  When included in the path, matches any character
        except a slash ('/').  Does not match the empty string.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>**</code> &ndash; Matches any sequence of characters.  Does match
        the empty string.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Site names are arbitrary strings that represent a given site and are
computed by NoSquint based on the current page's URL and the user-defined list
of exceptions.  For instance, both <code>foo.example.com</code> and
<code>myapp.*.example.com</code> could be site names, depending on the
exceptions defined.  NoSquint looks up zoom levels based on the site name.  The
site name, as determined by NoSquint, can be viewed in the tooltip by hovering
over the magnifying glass in the status bar, or by opening the Site Settings
dialog by left clicking the magnifying glass in the status bar.</p>

<p>When a wildcard is enclosed in square brackets (i.e. <code>[*]</code> or
<code>[**]</code>), the literal wildcard (<code>*</code> or <code>**</code>)
will be used in the site name instead of the characters the wildcard matches.
This is allows you to group together locations.  For example, if the page's URL
is <code>google.ca</code> and you've defined an exception
<code>google.[*]</code>, the site name will be <code>google.*</code>.  Since
<code>google.fi</code> matches this pattern, the site name would also be
<code>google.*</code>.  Therefore, <code>google.ca</code> and
<code>google.fi</code> would be considered the same site.</p>

<p>Hostnames and paths are evaluated separately; an exception pattern is split
into two sub-patterns, one for the host, and one for the path.  These
sub-patterns match substrings, but hosts are right-anchored, while paths are
left-anchored.  This means that any wildcards specified in the host name will
not match any characters in the path, and vice versa.  When the hostname part
of a pattern is only <code>*</code>, it matches the domain of the page's URL.
For example, for <code>www.google.com</code>, a single <code>*</code> matches
<code>google.com</code>; for <code>www.bbc.co.uk</code> it matches
<code>bbc.co.uk</code>.</p>

<p>Hostname parts can optionally contain a port number, which is delimited from
the hostname with a <code>:</code> (colon).  For example, <code>*:8080</code> will
cause port 8080 for all domains to be treated separately, so that
<code>www.example.com</code> is considered a different site than
<code>www.example.com:8080</code> (but, assuming no other exceptions than
this, <code>www.example.com:8001</code> is still considered the same site
as <code>www.example.com</code> or <code>www.example.com:4242</code>).</p>

<p>Any exception whose host part is the null string &ndash; in other words, the
exception begins with a <code>/</code> (front slash) &ndash; is applied only to
<code>file://</code> URLs.  So the exception <code>/home/*</code> for Linux or
<code>/C:/Users/*</code> for Windows Vista causes all home directories to be
treated distinctly from one another.</p>

<p>When multiple exception patterns match a page's URL, NoSquint will use the
exception that matches the most non-wildcard characters in the host name.  If
there are still multiple exceptions in that narrowed list, the exception that
matches the most non-wildcard characters in the path is then chosen.  If still
there are multiple exceptions, the first one that matched is chosen.</p>
